	<h3 ><p style="color:white" class=" serif" ALIGN="CENTER";>light is ultimately what makes or breaks a picture. But you can't rush light. The Earth goes around the sun, and sometimes you have to wait for months to have the sun in a way that makes sense for your picture. And then, on that special day, you better hope the weather is right! <img src="Autumn\img2.jpg"  ALIGN="left" alt="3" style="width:20%"  ></h><h2 style="color:white" class=" serif" ALIGN="CENTER";> <img src="Autumn\img3.jpg"  ALIGN="right" alt="3" style="width:17%"  >
	So far, the weather has NEVER been what was needed. Sure other landscape photographers experienced the same things I did: that special moment, where the weather is just perfect, you've waited for years for it, and finally, it is here. The few times it happenes. It is like finally meeting a lover you haven't seen for years, and knowing this moment will only last seconds before it is gone. The  photojournalist has a plethora of unique images to remind them the beauty .Make the experience fun even if it means getting a little wet at the end of the day. Your clients will love it, and so will you.</h>
