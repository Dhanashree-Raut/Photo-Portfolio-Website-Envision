Capturing the magnificent beauty of the corners from the world.Photographs are the universal language of our era. Everyone has hundreds, maybe thousands in their pocket.Weightless, they turn the scale when the argument is: What happened here? Images don’t age or warp.<img src="Summer\img2.jpg"  ALIGN="left" alt="3" style="width:30%"  >  A great photographer’s strings never go out of tune.It is for this reason that we need photographers.This art, this madness, this compulsion to convey a story we know as photojournalism will not die, storytelling will not die, it will change and evolve but it is human nature to want to learn, to be educated and to understand our world through narratives. They are the ones who sort all the chaos of the world into images that bring clarity to the free-for-all of life. <img src="Summer\img3.jpg"  ALIGN="right" alt="3" style="width:30%"  >They are the witnesses and artists who can distill the mayhem and beauty that surrounds us. They call our attention to the things we miss in our everyday lives and they call our attention to events and people at a great distance from our own patch of the universe. When they direct our eyes and hearts with precision and honesty, we know what we know differently and better. Photographers teach us to look again, look harder. Look through their eyes. <img src="Summer\img4.jpg"  ALIGN="left" alt="3" style="width:30%"  ><br>Photography speaks.Believe in light. Photography is light. That light is often shined into the darkest of places by the world’s bravest and most talented photojournalists.Believe in light. Photography is light. That light is often shined into the darkest of places by the world’s bravest and most talented photojournalists.Light is ultimately what makes or breaks a picture. But you can't rush . The Earth goes around the sun, and sometimes you have to wait for months to have the sun in a way that makes sense for your picture. And then, on that special day, you better hope the weather is right!
 		So far, the weather has NEVER been what was needed. Sure other landscape photographers experienced the same things I did: that special moment, where the weather is just perfect, you've waited for years for it, and finally, it is here. The few times happenes. It is like finally meeting a lover you haven't seen for years, and knowing this moment will only last seconds before it is gone.It can be difficult, at times, to work with photographers, I love to reveal them, to help them edit, to build, with them, a story. After all these years, I have the same passion for this witnesses of what we’re living through. They are our eyes. They show us what’s happening. They astonish us. They move us. They make us smile, sometimes. Cry, as well. </h><h2 style="color:white" class=" serif" ALIGN="CENTER";>Life without all these encounters, so enriching, so surprising, so astonishing is incomplete. Life! </h>
