		<h3 ><p style="color:white" class=" serif" ALIGN="CENTER";> Wedding has always been a tradition to show the grand gesture of love by celebrating it with the loved ones, with an asupacious welcome of the newly married couple to a new family.A wedding is not just the culmination of a couple’s commitment. It’s also the final product of much planning and preparation. Yet despite the best-laid plans, your big day won’t necessarily get a free pass from Murphy’s Law.  <img src="Winter\img2.jpg"  ALIGN="left" alt="3" style="width:30%"  >Some chaos is almost inevitable at some point along the way. Luckily, when you hire a wedding photojournalist, you have someone on hand who is an expert in capturing those moments as memorable visual stories that you’ll enjoy for years to come.<br>
		Nobody knows better than a wedding photojournalist that wedding days can almost seem to breed disorder. At the same time, it’s possible that no one could be better prepared to deal with the unexpected.For one thing, they’ve been behind the scenes at many other weddings prior to yours. Wedding photojournalists aren’t as intimidated by the hustle and bustle and know how to blend into the surroundings to document the unique moments of the day. <img src="Winter\img3.jpg"  ALIGN="right" alt="3" style="width:20%" > Sometimes, the chaos of the wedding day comes together in ways that no one can fully anticipate, which is, after all, part of the excitement. A brief panic just seconds before the ceremony as several guests surround the bride and all scramble to help her with her necklace can make for an active and memorable photo. In moments like these, our members have said, a bit skill, as well as luck, are necessary.With a moment occurring so fast, they cannot necessarily wait for the perfect arrangement of hands around the necklace, for instance. However, the ability to anticipate that something might happen and get into the best position to capture it will go a long way towards capturing these brief, chaotic moments.</h><h2 style="color:white" class=" serif"  ALIGN="CENTER";>The wedding photojournalist has a plethora of uniqueimages to remind a couple of all the hectic  but memorable moments that made their wedding day truly theirs.</h>
